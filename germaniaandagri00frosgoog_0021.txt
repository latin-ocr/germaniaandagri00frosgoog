people, and the Zumi, aud Bntoues‚ and Mugilones, and Sibini,
and the Semnones, a large tribe of the Saevi. As I remarked
before, the Suevic peoples dwelt partly within and partly without
the forest, contiguous to the Getae. Now the greatest nationis
the Suevic, for it stretches from the Rhiue to the Elbe, aud part

Ι of it is situated even beyond the Elbe3 the Hermcndori, for

instance, and the Iangoeargi ; but at the present time these
last have been expelled entirely beyond that river. A common
feature in all these pecples is their facility in removing their
abodes‚ a facility arising from the scantiness of provisions, and
the absence of agriculture, or the accumulatior of wealth. They ,
dwell in bute, satisfyiug their wants from day to day, living
chiefly on their herda of cattle, like the Nomade races; in
