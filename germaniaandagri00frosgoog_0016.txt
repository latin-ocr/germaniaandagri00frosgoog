2 INTRODUOTION.

mentioned, which in the Germania are entirely omitted: for ’

instance, the Canninefates (H. ir. 15), the (ingemi (H. iv. 15),
the Tubantes (A. i. 51), the Amsivarii (A. xiii. 56)‚the Sugambri
(Α. ii. 26). Tacitus probably learned more as he advanced in
years, and carried out more fully his historical researohes. His
aim in this work seems not simply to diffuse information about
the barbarous tribes, s'o pertinacious in resisting Roman
aggression‚ but also to contrest their simplicity of life with the
. artificial civilination of his countrymen. He continuelly draws
attention to the contrest between the habits of the two people
(c. ¹19. 25), either direotly or implicitly; and in order to do
so in one particular (c. 26), atter remarking that money was
unknown amongst them, he proceeds to add—an observation
otherwise somewhat unnecessary‚ unless for the sake of stig-
matizing indirectly the vices of the Romans-that usury was
not preetised by them. It does not appear that Tacitus had
any peculiar means of obtaining information about Germany.
Cornelius Tacitus is mentioned by Pliny (vii. 17 Tauohnitz)
ss Procurator of Gellia Belgica3 but as Pliny died nn. 79,
this person cannot have been the Historiam nor I think is he
likelyto have been his father. There is not any reason to suppose
that Tacitus visited Germany. What he knew was derived
probably from the report brought home by those who had
taken pert in the great expeditione of Drusus and Germanicus,
and the accounts of tradere. The information, so far as it
relates to tribes bordering on the Rhine, and therefore well
known to the Romans, is no doubt precise and authentic; for
the account of remoter tribes Tacitus must hare been dependent
on rague hearsay and obscure report.
