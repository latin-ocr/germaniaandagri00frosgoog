Of all the German tribes, the Suevi are the greatest and
most warlike. They are said to occupy a hundred cantens,
from each of which they dravv a thousand fighting men every
year for service beyond 1110 frontiers. 'l'he rest, remaining at
home, support themselves aud the others ; and in turn, during
the following year, are engaged under arms3 while the former
stay at home. By this arrangement agriculture and military
service proceed without interruption. They possess no private
or separate lande, and 110 forbidden to remain more thau a
year in the same place of abode. They use little 00111, but
chiefly live on milk, and the flesh 01 their cattle, and spend
much 01 their time in hunting. Consequently from 1110 cba-

coldest districts they have inured themselves to the absence 01
all clothing, except skins, from the small size 01 vvhich the

rivers. They allow tradere 10 visit them, rather in order to
have means 01 disposing of spoil talren in war, than 110111
any desire 10 have foreign articles introduced amongst them.
Moreover‚ the Germane do not use imported beasts of burden,
which the Gauls delight in, and procure at high prices, their

are made capable of enduring extreme toil. In cavalry engage.
